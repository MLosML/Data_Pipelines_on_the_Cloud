## Summary
n this case study, Gans is a startup focused on creating an e-scooter-sharing system.
The company aims to operate in the worldâ€™s most populous cities.
In each city, Gans will deploy hundreds of e-scooters on the streets, allowing users to rent them by the minute.

**Focus of Gans**: Sustainable mobility
Operational Success: Depends on having scooters parked where users need them

**Ideal Scenario**:

Scooters are rearranged organically:
Users move from point A to point B
An even number of users move from point B to point A

**Asymmetries:**

Hilly Cities: Users ride scooters uphill and walk downhill
Morning Movement: General shift from residential neighborhoods to the city center
Rain: E-scooter usage drops drastically
Young Tourists: Potential users need scooters downtown or near touristic landmarks

**Solutions:**

Use trucks to move scooters around
Create economic incentives for users to pick up or leave scooters in certain areas

**Challenges**
- The company aims to anticipate scooter movements as much as possible.
- Predictive modeling is on the roadmap.
- The first step is to collect more data, transform it, and store it appropriately.
- The challenge will be to assemble and automate a data pipeline in the cloud.

**Phase 1: Local Pipeline**

**Objective**: Create a local data pipeline to collect, transform, and store data in a SQL database, laying the groundwork for a scalable and automated cloud pipeline.

Data Collection Methods:

**Web Scraping**: Automatically extract data from websites using programs or scripts. Ensure ethical practices by respecting copyright and privacy rights.
**APIs**: Access and retrieve data in a structured manner. Obtain necessary credentials for authentication.
Data Storage:

**SQL Database**: Build and maintain SQL databases to organize and manage data. Learn to create tables, insert data, and perform essential database operations.
